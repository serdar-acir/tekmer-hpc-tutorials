# NAMD

## General Information

NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) is a high-performance simulation software designed for large biomolecular systems.

It is widely used for:
- Molecular dynamics simulations  
- Protein structure analysis  
- Drug discovery and computational chemistry  
- Large-scale parallel simulations  

NAMD is optimized for:
- Parallel execution (MPI)  
- High scalability on HPC clusters  
- CPU and GPU acceleration  

On TEKMER HPC, NAMD is available on compute nodes and can be used for both small-scale and large-scale simulations.

---

## Availability

NAMD is installed on the TEKMER HPC cluster and is available to all authorized users.

It can also be used on:
- Workstations  
- Local Linux environments  

---

## Licensing

NAMD is free for academic and research use.

---

## Platform

- Linux (HPC cluster environment)

---

## Running NAMD on TEKMER HPC

NAMD should be executed via the job scheduler (Slurm).

### Example Slurm Job Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J namd_job
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 16
#SBATCH --time=02:00:00

module load namd

srun namd2 input.conf > output.log

###Submit the job:

sbatch job.sh
##Performance Considerations

Use multiple cores for better performance

Test small runs before large simulations

Optimize input configuration files

Consider GPU acceleration if available

##Best Practices

Avoid running NAMD directly on login nodes

Monitor jobs using squeue

Store only necessary output data

Clean temporary files after execution
