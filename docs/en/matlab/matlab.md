# MATLAB

## General Information

MATLAB is a high-level programming and numerical computing environment used for:
- Mathematical modeling and simulation  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Algorithm development  
- Engineering and scientific computing  

On TEKMER HPC, MATLAB can be used in:
- **Interactive mode** (for testing and development)
- **Batch mode** (for large-scale jobs via Slurm)
- **Parallel mode** using the Parallel Computing Toolbox

## Using MATLAB on TEKMER HPC

### Load MATLAB

```bash
module load matlab
Run Interactive Session (short tests only)
matlab

⚠️ Do NOT run heavy workloads interactively on login nodes.

Run Batch Job (Recommended)

Example Slurm script:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J matlab_job
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 4
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00

module load matlab

matlab -nodisplay -r "my_script; exit"

Submit with:

sbatch job.sh
Parallel Computing

MATLAB supports parallel execution via:

Parallel Computing Toolbox

parpool / parfor

Distributed jobs

Example:

parpool(4);
parfor i=1:100
    A(i) = heavy_function(i);
end
